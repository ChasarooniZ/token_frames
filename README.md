[Requested that frames be added to foundry package](https://github.com/jcolson/token_frames/issues/8).

"Hello, I've just made some tokens for Band of Blades, which I would like to share with everyone. It includes a blank token so people can create their own variations. Thanks!"

### Change of ownership and new token frames from volfied

Many thanks to Jay Colson for creating this module. In his absence, I have assumed direction of the project. I have also added some token frames of my own.

## Feel free to send pull requests for additional token frame content

If you have your own token frames that you would like to share with the Foundry community, please open a pull request here or open an [Issue](https://github.com/jcolson/token_frames/issues) and I'll do my best to incorporate your content in the next release.
