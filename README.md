# VTT Token Frames

Most of these token frames were harvested from other opensource projects.

## Import into FoundryVTT v9 or higher

- Go to the **Setup** area of Foundry VTT.
- Click on the **Add-on Modules** tab.
- Click on the **Install Module** button.
- Paste this url `https://github.com/jcolson/token_frames/releases/latest/download/module.json` in the **Manifest URL** field.
- Click on the **Install Module** button.

The new token frames will be available at: `modules/TokenFrames/token_frames`.

## Sourced from TokenTool

[TokenTool](https://github.com/RPTools/TokenTool), which uses the ["GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"](https://github.com/RPTools/TokenTool/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

## Sourced from MTVExtreme

[MTVExtreme](https://www.deviantart.com/mtvextreme) on DeviantArt made a few really cool token frames based on the seasons.

## Sourced from Jinker

[Jinker#8073](https://discord.com) on Discord made a really cool 'web' themed token.

## Token Usage

These work really well in the [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com)'s [Tokenizer module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/vtta-tokenizer/).  I'm sure they would be useful in other token tools as well.

Feel free to send pull requests for additional token frame content!
